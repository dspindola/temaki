# Welcome to Temaki ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Expo](https://expo.dev) with [Expo Router](https://expo.github.io/router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI Library**: [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev) - Universal UI components for React Native and Web
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS with Tamagui's styling system
- **Platform Support**: iOS, Android, and Web
- **Package Manager**: [Bun](https://bun.com)

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    bunx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Reset project

There's also a [reset-project script](./scripts/reset-project.js) included that moves the current **app** directory to **app-example** and creates a blank **app** directory for you to start over.
